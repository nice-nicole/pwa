# pwa2021
Programming Web Application, winter semester of 2021/22


## Getting started with code

Go to the selected location of your computer and enter the command:
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/mariusz.jarocki/pwa2021.git
```
It should create a pwa2021 folder. Open it using Visual Studio Code.

* To download the latest version of the project, use Source Control ... Pull in VS Code. Please remember about discarding your changes to avoid conflicts.
* To switch to working branches, click on the branch name in the bottom-left corner of VS Code window and select a branch by your laboratory group number.

## Execution environment

* If you haven't done so yet, install required modules by:
```
npm install
```
Please remember you have to enter the command also in the frontend folder (from the moment it needs support of external code, e.g., Bootstrap or AngularJS).
* The command
```
npm start
```
starts a backend (server) of our project. To stop it, press Ctrl+C (and maybe type Y and enter to confirm).
